# College
Repo for all college projects

This includes:

Classes in computational physics where we were introduced to different numerical techniques

Introductory C.S. Classes including python and C++/C projects

My STAR project on computational astrophysics

Overall the Repo includes assignments/homeworks/practice problems, therefore not all code is properly committed/syntax may be non standard.
